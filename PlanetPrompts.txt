Create a mesmerizing pixel-art style representation of a geode-inspired planet. Black background behind the planet, nothing else. Envision its circular boundary protecting a treasure trove of radiant, sparkling crystals. The rocky, muted exterior should belie the true beauty inside. As the crust fractures, dazzling formations of amethyst, teal, and fiery ruby should emerge. The surface should play with light, reflecting and refracting in a dance of colors. Some areas might suggest crystalline forests or cities, hinting at a civilization that thrives on the energy of these gems. Subtle gradient shifts, luminescent glow effects, and sharp contrasts should make this planet a visual delight.

Craft for me an intricate pixel art representation of a frozen, isolated planet. Envision it as a crystalline jewel in the vastness of space.  Black background behind the planet, nothing else. The circular form should capture sprawling glaciers that crack and creak, and icy oceans that whirl in tempestuous dances. Beneath the thick ice layers, hints of mysterious dark abysses or concealed underwater civilizations can be subtly indicated. Use a varied palette dominated by blues—from cerulean for shallow waters to navy for deeper areas—with patches of pristine white icebergs and lavender for twilight reflections. Pixelated frost particles should add a sparkling, ethereal quality to the surface, hinting at the absolute cold.
