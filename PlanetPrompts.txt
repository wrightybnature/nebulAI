Create a mesmerizing pixel-art style representation of a geode-inspired planet. Black background behind the planet, nothing else. Envision its circular boundary protecting a treasure trove of radiant, sparkling crystals. The rocky, muted exterior should belie the true beauty inside. As the crust fractures, dazzling formations of amethyst, teal, and fiery ruby should emerge. The surface should play with light, reflecting and refracting in a dance of colors. Some areas might suggest crystalline forests or cities, hinting at a civilization that thrives on the energy of these gems. Subtle gradient shifts, luminescent glow effects, and sharp contrasts should make this planet a visual delight.

"Envision a pixel-art style inferno planet. Black background behind the planet, nothing else. The fiery landscape should burst with intense reds and oranges, with dynamic flames rendered in a cascade of warm-toned pixels. The movement of the flames should be almost palpable, with the brightest areas suggesting extreme heat and energy. High resolution, Blazing clarity, Detailed 8k, Intense depth of field, SSAA anti-aliasing --s 750 --v 5.2 --style raw."

"Create a pixel-art style visualization of a dust-covered planet. Black background behind the planet, nothing else. The hues should be subdued, capturing a palette of grays, tans, and muted yellows, giving the impression of a thick blanket of dust over the landscape. The art should convey a sense of stillness, with pixelated dust clouds gently rising from the surface. High resolution, Dusty clarity, Detailed 8k, Soft depth of field, SSAA anti-aliasing --s 750 --v 5.2 --style raw."

"Imagine a pixel-art style technologically advanced planet. Black background behind the planet, nothing else. The planet should be encrusted with intricate patterns of metallic grays and silvers, punctuated by lights of various colors to represent a highly urbanized surface. Pixels should come together to form complex structures resembling cities and machinery, possibly hinting at an interconnected global network.
